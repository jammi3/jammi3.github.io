		<small>To ensure the warranty guarantee, a successful debit must be made from your specified payment method (direct debit or credit card) before the agreed delivery date specified on the product page is possible. On Pay By Invoice, the valid payment conditions need to be fulfilled. Pay By Invoice is not possible with shipment to a pick-up point (such as Packstations and post-24 machines. We recommend payment by credit card or direct debit, as the Pay By Invoice payment method can delay processing your shipment.

The payment warranty does not apply with payment by credit card if the debit from the specified credit card account was not successful before the expiry of the stated timeframe on the product page.

If the premium shipping option is no longer available for any reason during the order process (for example because the time window just passed or the availability of an item changed), then the delivery guarantee is void.

With deliveries made to a home address, the delivery agent generally requires a signature on delivery. The delivery guarantee is fulfilled with the first attempted delivery even if the compulsory signature recipient was not reached.

If delivery is made to a pick-up point, the delivery guarantee is fulfilled upon the shipmentâ€™s arrival at the pick-up point. You will be informed of this by SMS or e-mail.

Please note that the availability of an item initially relates to the order of a copy. So it can be the case that with orders made where several copies of an item are requested not all of the items will have the same delivery speed.

Claims for damages beyond refund of shipping costs are excluded.</small>
